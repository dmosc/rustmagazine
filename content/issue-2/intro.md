Dear Rustaceans,

Welcome to the second issue of Rust Magazine! We are excited to bring you another round of engaging articles and tutorials from the Rust community.

In this issue, we explore topics ranging from optimizing Rust binary search to designing an API for a user-friendly retry crate. We also have an interview with `@sunli`, the creator of popular crates such as [async-graphql] and [poem], as well as a conversation with ChatGPT on the topic of Rust lifetimes. Additionally, we feature articles on [Egg](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg), a popular Rust framework to help build a SQL optimizer, and an applicative command-line parser with Category Theory.

Thank you to our authors for their contributions and dedication to the Rust community. We couldn't have done it without you.

As we close the chapter on Issue 2, we are excited to announce that we are looking for articles for Issue 3, and we would love to hear from you. Do you have a Rust project you want to share with the community? Have you learned something new about Rust that you want to pass on? Or do you have an idea for a Rust-related article that you would like to explore? Please don't hesitate to submit your proposal via our website. Let's make Rust Magazine a platform for everyone to share their Rust experience and knowledge!

Best regards,

The Rust Magazine Team.
